## COMP 318 Algorithms - Project 3 
### Description - ***Greedy & Dynamic Programming***
This project explores the design and implementation of algorithms to manage currency distribution effectively, 
specifically focusing on the greedy and dynamic programming approaches to solve the change-making problem. 
The project aims to find the most efficient way to combine different denominations to reach a specified total, 
illustrating the concepts of algorithm optimization and complexity.

#### **Highlights of the project:**

* **Interactive User Input:** Allows users to enter a specific amount and observe how each algorithm tackles the change-making problem.
* **Change-Making Problem:** Calculates the minimum number of bills and coins needed to reach a specific amount using different denominations.
* **Greedy Algorithm:** Quickly computes a solution by always taking the best immediate or local solution, ensuring rapid execution but not always guaranteeing the best global solution.
* **Dynamic Programming Algorithm:** Breaks down the problem into simpler subproblems and solves them once, storing their solutions to avoid redundant computations, ensuring an optimal solution is found.
* **Comparison and Analysis:** Evaluates and compares the efficiency of both algorithms in terms of time and space complexities.
* **Result Visualization:** Displays detailed steps of both algorithms, showing the number of each denomination used and the progress towards the total amount.

##### This project contains multiple files that divide the workload.
- main.cpp: <br>
    This file is used to test the AVL Trees implementation. It creates a tree, inserts nodes, displays the tree, and deletes nodes. 
    It also displays the tree after deletion.

- changeMaker.cpp:<br>
    This file is used to create the AVL Trees Object Data Structure which holds the nodes of the tree and the methods to manipulate the tree.

- changeMaker.h:<br>
  This is the header file for the AVLtrees.cpp file. It contains the three classes hierarchy (binaryTreeClass, binarySearchTreeClass, balancedBinarySearchTreeClass) and the methods' prototypes. <br>

****************************

## Getting Started

#### This program uses the following libraries:

- #include <iostream> // For input-output
- #include <array>    // For Greedy Programming
- #include <vector>   // For Dynamic Programming
- #include <cmath>    // For INT_MAX
- #include <string>   // For string manipulation
- #include <iomanip>  // For setw

#### CMake Minimum version
- cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.27)

### Compiler version
- Clang C++ compiler

### Installing /compiling

#### On CLion

After downloading the code, please create a new project on CLion and select the folder containing the program as the project folder.
It will ask you to either use the files existing inside the folder or create a blank design, please select to use the files inside the folder.
The CMakeList.txt file and cmake-build-debug folder should include all the necessary files needed to run this program on CLion.

### Executing program

#### On CLion

```
We could see that always dp < greedy

Which result that dp is always more efficient but sometimes greedy is the same as dp

we could see the difference between the two algorithms in larger numbers where dp is more efficient than greedy


Time complexity


Space complexity


Time efficiency
Space efficiency
Which approach is better? Why? Is it always the case?
